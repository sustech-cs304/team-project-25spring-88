## Project Introduction
SUSTech Campus Racing Game is a racing game set on a 1:1 recreation of the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) campus. The game features multiple modes, including Classic Racing, Multiplayer Racing, Item Racing, and AI Chase. Players can explore the campus, learn about its layout, and enjoy a realistic weather system that brings the campus to life under various conditions.

The main goal of the game is to help students and players become more familiar with the SUSTech campus while having fun. All campus buildings and landmarks are faithfully recreated, providing an immersive and educational experience.

### Classic Racing Mode
![racingscene](resource\regulargamescene.png)
In the main menu, click **Regular Race** to enter Regular Racing Mode. In Classic Racing Mode, players start in front of the Third Teaching Building and race along the route of SUSTech Bus Line 1, returning to the starting point to complete the race. To ensure fair play and encourage campus exploration, there are barriers only on the outer edge of the track. Six checkpoints are placed along the route; players must pass through all checkpoints for their results to be recorded. If you get lost, press **R** to return to the last checkpoint.

### Multiplayer Racing Mode
In the main menu, click **Race with Friends** to enter Multiplayer Racing Mode. In Multiplayer Racing Mode, one player should click "Host Game" to create a room. Other players on the same local network can join by entering the host's IP address and the auto-generated password. Once all players are ready, the host can start the race. The rules are the same as in Classic Racing Mode.

### Item Racing Mode
In the main menu, click **Item Race** to enter Item Racing Mode. Item Racing Mode is similar to Classic Racing, but with a twist: mysterious item boxes are randomly placed on the track. When a player passes through a box, they receive a random effect, such as car spinning, stopping, speed up, slow down, or reversed controls (left/right).

### AI Chase Mode
In the main menu, click **Item Race** to enter AI Chase Mode. In AI Chase Mode, players must escape from computer-controlled chasers and try to finish the race without being caught. Similarly, compared to other modes, you can see the positions of computer-controlled opponents displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen in real-time. Additionally, a distance indicator at the top of the screen shows how far the computer-controlled chasers are from you, allowing you to plan your escape route or adjust your strategy to avoid being caught.
